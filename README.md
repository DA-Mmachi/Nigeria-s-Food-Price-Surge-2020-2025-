# How ₦100 Worth of Food Changed in 5 Years: A Data-Driven Insight into Nigeria’s Food Price Surge (2020–2025)

## Project Overview

As an Economist and Data Analyst, I combined my domain knowledge and analytical skills to investigate Nigeria’s rising food prices between 2020 and January–June 2025. The goal was to make inflation relatable by answering a simple but powerful question: What can ₦100 buy now vs 5 years ago? This Power BI project visualizes food price changes for eight staple food items across Nigeria using real market data, with insights designed for policymakers, analysts, and everyday Nigerians.

## Data Sources

- Primary Source:Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)-Food Price Watch Reports (2020–2025)

- Exchange Rate Data:Central Bank of Nigeria and verified media records

- Inflation Rate Data:National Inflation Rate as published by NBS (Monthly Consumer Price Index Reports)

## Data Tools

- Microsoft Power BI - Dashboard development and visual storytelling

- Microsoft Excel - Data collection, cleaning, and transformation

- SQL and Python - for automated data handling

## Data Cleaning / Preparation

- Consolidated monthly food price data from 2020 and Jan–June 2025 using Excel

- Standardized units across food items (e.g., per kg, 1L, or per loaf)

- Handled missing values by referencing adjacent months or cross-validating with multiple reports

- Removed formatting inconsistencies (symbols, spaces, typos)

- Estimated missing 2025 values where unavailable using logical approximations based on market trends

- Added calculated columns for % price change and comparative analysis (2020 vs 2025)

## Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
To explore trends and hidden insights, I asked:

- What is the average price increase of each staple item between 2020 and 2025?[Answer1](#answer1)

- Which food items experienced the steepest price surge?[Answer2](#answer2)

- How did inflation and exchange rate movement correlate with food price jumps?[Answer3A](#answer3a)[Answer3B](#answer3b)

- What does ₦100 buy in 2025 compared to 2020 item by item?[Answer4](#answer4)

## Data Analysis

- Used DAX calculations in Power BI to measure:
                     -  Percentage price change across years
                     -  Average cost per item over time
                     - Monthly trends for Jan–June 2025
- Created dynamic visual filters to segment insights by month or food item

- Employed 100% stacked bar charts, trend lines, and KPI cards to highlight key metrics

- Visualized macroeconomic context by incorporating inflation rates and exchange rate shifts
