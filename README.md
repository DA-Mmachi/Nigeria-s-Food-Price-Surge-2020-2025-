# How ₦100 Worth of Food Changed in 5 Years: A Data-Driven Insight into Nigeria’s Food Price Surge (2020–2025)

## Project Overview

As an Economist and Data Analyst, I combined my domain knowledge and analytical skills to investigate Nigeria’s rising food prices between 2020 and January–June 2025. The goal was to make inflation relatable by answering a simple but powerful question: What can ₦100 buy now vs 5 years ago? This Power BI project visualizes food price changes for eight staple food items across Nigeria using real market data, with insights designed for policymakers, analysts, and everyday Nigerians.

## Data Sources

- Primary Source:Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)-Food Price Watch Reports (2020–2025)

- Exchange Rate Data:Central Bank of Nigeria and verified media records

- Inflation Rate Data:National Inflation Rate as published by NBS (Monthly Consumer Price Index Reports)

## Data Tools

- Microsoft Power BI - Dashboard development and visual storytelling

- Microsoft Excel - Data collection, cleaning, and transformation

- SQL and Python - for automated data handling

## Data Cleaning / Preparation

- Consolidated monthly food price data from 2020 and Jan–June 2025 using Excel

- Standardized units across food items (e.g., per kg, 1L, or per loaf)

- Handled missing values by referencing adjacent months or cross-validating with multiple reports

- Removed formatting inconsistencies (symbols, spaces, typos)

- Estimated missing 2025 values where unavailable using logical approximations based on market trends

- Added calculated columns for % price change and comparative analysis (2020 vs 2025)

## Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
To explore trends and hidden insights, I asked:

- What is the average price increase of each staple item between 2020 and 2025?

- Which food items experienced the steepest price surge?

- How did inflation and exchange rate movement correlate with food price jumps?

- What does ₦100 buy in 2025 compared to 2020 item by item?

## Data Analysis

- Used DAX calculations in Power BI to measure:
                     -  Percentage price change across years
                     -  Average cost per item over time
                     - Monthly trends for Jan–June 2025
- Created dynamic visual filters to segment insights by month or food item

- Employed 100% stacked bar charts, trend lines, and KPI cards to highlight key metrics

- Visualized macroeconomic context by incorporating inflation rates and exchange rate shifts

## Results and Findings

- Average Food Price Increase (2020–2025): Over 380%

- Inflation Rate (May 2025): 21%

- Exchange Rate Shift: ₦361 → ₦1,525 (official rate)

- Biggest Price Surge: Yam tuber and Groundnut Oil

- ₦100 could barely buy a slice of bread in 2025 — items that once cost ₦80–₦100 now exceed ₦300–₦400


## Recommendation

- Strengthen domestic food production and supply chains to reduce reliance on imports

- Prioritize inflation control strategies via monetary and fiscal policy coordination

- Invest in market price monitoring systems to enhance transparency

- Launch public education tools using simple data visuals for better awareness of inflation’s impact


  ## Limitations

  - NBS does not provide complete 2025 monthly data beyond June
  
  - Estimations were made using current market rates for unavailable entries
  
  - The dataset represents national averages regional price differences were not deeply explored
